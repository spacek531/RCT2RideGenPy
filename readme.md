A python implementation of X123M3-256's RCT2 Ride Generator to work with OpenRCT2's json object format.

Planned implementation:

- PyForms gui
- natively uses OpenRCT2 json object format
- extend OpenRCT2 json object format for finer control of ride during editing phase
- interface with oli414's blender plugin for sprite generation
